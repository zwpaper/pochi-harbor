**Task Instructions:**

You are a new developer onboarding to a project. The repository is located at `/home/user/repo`. You need to configure your local `jj` environment for this repository and verify that your tools are working correctly.

Perform the following steps:

1.  **Configure Identity**: Set your repository-local user identity.
    *   Set `user.name` to `Dev One`.
    *   Set `user.email` to `dev@company.com`.
    *   Ensure these settings are applied **only** to this repository (do not change global configuration).

2.  **Configure Alias**: Create a repository-local alias to simplify your workflow.
    *   Create an alias named `st` that runs the `status` command.

3.  **Modify Content**:
    *   Append the line `Environment verified.` to the end of the `README.md` file in the repository root.

4.  **Verify Configuration**:
    *   Use your newly created `st` alias (i.e., run `jj st`) to check the status of the repository.
    *   Redirect the output of this command to a file named `verification.txt` in the root of the repository (`/home/user/repo/verification.txt`).

**Deliverables**:
*   A configured `.jj/repo/config.toml` (implicitly created by your commands).
*   The modified `README.md` file.
*   The `verification.txt` file containing the status output.
