You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration comes through as direct, factual statements. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nYou avoid cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance, or any kind of fluff. You don't comment on user requests, positively or negatively, unless there is reason for escalation. You don't feel like you need to fill the space with words, you stay concise and communicate what is necessary for user collaboration - not more, not less.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You have 2 ways of communicating with the users:\n- Share intermediary updates in `commentary` channel. \n- After you have completed all your work, send a message to the `final` channel.\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly.\n\n## Autonomy and persistence\nPersist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible: do not stop at analysis or partial fixes; carry changes through implementation, verification, and a clear explanation of outcomes unless the user explicitly pauses or redirects you.\n\nUnless the user explicitly asks for a plan, asks a question about the code, is brainstorming potential solutions, or some other intent that makes it clear that code should not be written, assume the user wants you to make code changes or run tools to solve the user's problem. In these cases, it's bad to output your proposed solution in a message, you should go ahead and actually implement the change. If you encounter challenges or blockers, you should attempt to resolve them yourself.\n\n## Formatting rules\n\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use markdown links (not inline code) for clickable file paths.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * For clickable/openable file references, the path target must be an absolute filesystem path. Labels may be short (for example, `[app.ts](/abs/path/app.ts)`).\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis or em dashes unless explicitly instructed.\n\n## Final answer instructions\n\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n## Intermediary updates \n\n- Intermediary updates go to the `commentary` channel.\n- User updates are short updates while you are working, they are NOT final answers.\n- You use 1-2 sentence user updates to communicated progress and new information to the user as you are doing work. \n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- You provide user updates frequently, every 20s.\n- Before exploring or doing substantial work, you start with a user update acknowledging the request and explaining your first step. You should include your understanding of the user request and explain what you will do. Avoid commenting on the request or using starters such at \"Got it -\" or \"Understood -\" etc.\n- When exploring, e.g. searching, reading files you provide user updates as you go, every 20s, explaining what context you are gathering and what you've learned. Vary your sentence structure when providing these updates to avoid sounding repetitive - in particular, don't start each sentence the same way.\n- After you have sufficient context, and the work is substantial you provide a longer plan (this is the only user update that may be longer than 2 sentences and can contain formatting).\n- Before performing file edits of any kind, you provide updates explaining what edits you are making.\n- As you are thinking, you very frequently provide updates even if not taking any actions, informing the user of your progress. You interrupt your thinking and send multiple updates in a row if thinking for more than 100 words.\n- Tone of your updates MUST match your personality.\n"}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /logs/agent/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /logs/agent/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The\n          working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the\n          working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead\n          see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be\n          useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the\n          working copy.\n          \n          Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies\n          `--ignore-working-copy`.\n\n      --ignore-immutable\n          Allow rewriting immutable commits\n          \n          By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits.\n          This option disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.\n          \n          This option only affects the check.

For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would\n          have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the\n          same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.\n          \n          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation\n          ID is enough.\n          \n          When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if\n          `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.\n          \n          It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation.\n          Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier\n          operation.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /logs/agent/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /logs/agent/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

These cannot be edited. They can be viewed in the\n  `cli/src/config/` directory in `jj`'s source repo.\n\n- The user settings. These can be edited with `jj config edit --user`. User\nsettings are located in [the user config files], which can be found with `jj\nconfig path --user`.\n\n- The repo settings. These can be edited with `jj config edit --repo`, or found\n  with `jj config path --repo`. For security reasons, they are not located inside\n  the repo.\n\n- The workspace settings. These can be edited with `jj config edit --workspace`,\n  or found with `jj config path --workspace`. For security reasons, they are not\n  located inside the workspace.\n\n- Settings [specified in the command-line](#specifying-config-on-the-command-line).\n\nThese are listed in the order they are loaded; the settings from earlier items\nin the list are overridden by the settings from later items if they disagree.\nEvery type of config except for the built-in settings is optional.\n\nYou can enable JSON Schema validation in your editor by adding a `#:schema`\nreference at the top of your TOML config files. See [JSON Schema\nSupport] for details.\n\nSee the [TOML site] and the [syntax guide] for a detailed description of the\nsyntax. We cover some of the basics below.\n\n[the user config files]: #user-config-files\n[TOML site]: https://toml.io/en/\n[syntax guide]: https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0\n[JSON Schema Support]: #json-schema-support\n\nThe first thing to remember is that the value of a setting (the part to the\nright of the `=` sign) should be surrounded in quotes if it's a string.\n\n### Dotted style and headings\nIn TOML, anything under a heading can be dotted instead. For example,\n`user.name = \"YOUR NAME\"` is equivalent to:\n\n```toml\n[user]\nname = \"YOUR NAME\"\n```\n\nFor future reference, here are a couple of more complicated examples,\n\n```toml\n# Dotted style\ntemplate-aliases.\"format_short_id(id)\" = \"id.shortest(12)\"\ncolors.\"commit_id prefix\".bold = true\n\n# is equivalent to:\n[template-aliases]\n\"format_short_id(id)\" = \"id.shortest(12)\"\n\n[colors]\n\"commit_id prefix\" = { bold = true }\n```\n\nThe docs below refer to keys in text using dotted notation, but example\nblocks will use heading notation to be unambiguous. If you are confident with TOML\nthen use whichever suits you in your config. If you mix dotted keys and headings,\n**you must put the dotted keys before the first heading**.\n\nThat's probably enough TOML to keep you out of trouble but the [syntax guide] is\nvery short if you ever need to check.\n\n## User settings\n\n```toml\n[user]\nname = \"YOUR NAME\"\nemail = \"YOUR_EMAIL@example.com\"\n```\n\nDon't forget to change these to your own details!\n\n## UI settings\n\n### Colorizing output\n\nPossible values are `always`, `never`, `debug` and `auto` (default: `auto`).\n`auto` will use color only when writing to a terminal. `debug` will print the\nactive labels alongside the regular colorized output.\n\nThis setting overrides the `NO_COLOR` environment variable (if set).\n\n```toml\n[ui]\ncolor = \"never\" # Turn off color\n```\n\n### Custom colors and styles\n\nYou can customize the colors used for various elements of the UI. For example:\n\n```toml\n[colors]\ncommit_id = \"green\"\n```\n\nThe following colors are available:\n\n* black\n* red\n* green\n* yellow\n* blue\n* magenta\n* cyan\n* white\n* default\n\nAll of them but \"default\" come in a bright version too, e.g. \"bright red\". The\n\"default\" color can be used to override a color defined by a parent style\n(explained below).\n\nYou can also use a 6-digit hex code for more control over the exact color used:\n\n```toml\n[colors]\nchange_id = \"#ff1525\"\n```\n\n`jj` also supports colors from the [ANSI 256-color palette] as `ansi-color-<N>`,\nwhere `<N>` is a number between 0 and 255:\n\n```toml\n[colors]\ncommit_id = \"ansi-color-81\"\n```\n\n[ANSI 256-color palette]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit\n\nIf you use a string value for a color, as in the examples above, it will be used\nfor the foreground color. You can also set the background color, reverse colors\n(swap foreground and background), or make the text bold, dim, italic, or\nunderlined. For that, you need to use a table:\n\n```toml\n[colors]\ncommit_id = { fg = \"green\", bg = \"#ff1525\", bold = true, underline = true }\nchange_id = { reverse = true, dim = false, italic = true }\n```\n\nThe key names are called \"labels\". The above used `commit_id` as label. You can\nalso create rules combining multiple labels. The rules work a bit like CSS\nselectors. For example, if you want to color commit IDs green in general but\nmake the commit ID of the working-copy commit also be underlined, you can do\nthis:\n\n```toml\n[colors]\ncommit_id = \"green\"\n\"working_copy commit_id\" = { underline = true }\n```\n\nParts of the style that are not overridden - such as the foreground color in the\nexample above - are inherited from the style of the parent label.\n\nWhich elements can be colored is not yet documented, but see\nthe [default color configuration](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/cli/src/config/colors.toml)\nfor some examples of what's possible.\n\n### Default command\n\nWhen `jj` is run with no explicit subcommand, the value of the\n`ui.default-command` setting will be used instead. Possible values are any valid\nsubcommand name, subcommand alias, or user-defined alias (defaults to `\"log\"`).\n\n```toml\n[ui]\ndefault-command = [\"log\", \"--reversed\"]\n```\n\n### Default description\n\nThe editor content of a commit description can be populated by the\n`draft_commit_description` template. `self` is a [`Commit`\nobject](templates.md#commit-type).\n\n```toml\n[templates]\ndraft_commit_description = '''\nconcat(\n  builtin_draft_commit_description,\n  \"\\nJJ: ignore-rest\\n\",\n  diff.git(),\n)\n'''\n```\n\nYou can override only the `default_commit_description` value if you like, e.g.:\n\n```toml\n[template-aliases]\ndefault_commit_description = '''\n\"\n\nCloses #NNNN\n\"\n'''\n```\n\n### Duplicate commit description\n\nBy default, `jj duplicate` copies the descriptions from the original commits.\nYou can customize this behavior by specifying the `duplicate_description`\ntemplate, which is given a [`Commit` object](templates.md#commit-type) of the\noriginal commit.\n\n```toml\n[templates]\nduplicate_description = '''\nconcat(\n  description.trim_end(),\n  \"\\n\\n(cherry picked from commit \",\n  commit_id,\n  \")\\n\"\n)\n'''\n```\n\nNote that `description` usually ends with a `\\n` if it is not blank. Use\n`.trim_end()` to remove the `\\n`.\n\n### Bookmark/tag listing order\n\nBy default, `jj bookmark list` and `jj tag list` display bookmarks and tags\nsorted alphabetically by name. You can customize this sorting behavior by\nspecifying sort keys in your config file:\n\n```toml\n[ui]\nbookmark-list-sort-keys = [\"name\"]\ntag-list-sort-keys = [\"name\"]\n```\n\nThe configuration works identically to using the `--sort` option. The following\nsort keys are supported: `name`, `author-name`, `author-email`, `author-date`,\n`committer-name`, `committer-email`, `committer-date`. Suffix the key with `-`\nto sort in descending order. Multiple keys can be supplied here, the first key\nis the most significant.\n\nWhen the `--sort` option is used, the configuration is ignored.\n\n### Commit trailers\n\nYou can configure automatic addition of one or more trailers to commit\ndescriptions using the `commit_trailers` template.\n\n"}}

If string value isn't enclosed by any\n          TOML constructs (such as apostrophes or array notation), quotes can be omitted. Note that\n          the value may also need shell quoting. TOML multi-line strings can be useful if the value\n          contains apostrophes. For example, to set `foo.bar` to the string \"{don't}\" use `jj config\n          set --user foo.bar \"'''{don't}'''\"`. This is valid in both Bash and Fish.\n          \n          Alternative, e.g. to avoid dealing with shell quoting, use `jj config edit` to edit the\n          TOML file directly.\n\nOptions:\n      --user\n          Target the user-level config\n\n      --repo\n          Target the repo-level config\n\n      --workspace\n          Target the workspace-level config\n\n  -h, --help\n          Print help (see a summary with '-h')\n\nGlobal Options:\n  -R, --repository <REPOSITORY>\n          Path to repository to operate on\n          \n          By default, Jujutsu searches for the closest .jj/ directory in an ancestor of the current\n          working directory.\n\n      --ignore-working-copy\n          Don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it\n          \n          By default, Jujutsu snapshots the working copy at the beginning of every command. The\n          working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the\n          working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead\n          see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be\n          useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the\n          working copy.\n          \n          Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies\n          `--ignore-working-copy`.\n\n      --ignore-immutable\n          Allow rewriting immutable commits\n          \n          By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits.\n          This option disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.\n          \n          This option only affects the check. It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or\n          the `immutable` template keyword.\n\n      --at-operation <AT_OPERATION>\n          Operation to load the repo at\n          \n          Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent\n          operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.\n          \n          You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier\n          operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would\n          have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the\n          same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.\n          \n          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation\n          ID is enough.\n          \n          When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if\n          `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.\n          \n          It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation.\n          Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier\n          operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.\n          \n          [aliases: --at-op]\n\n      --debug\n          Enable debug logging\n\n      --color <WHEN>\n          When to colorize output\n          \n          [possible values: always, never, debug, auto]\n\n      --quiet\n          Silence non-primary command output\n          \n          For example, `jj file list` will still list files, but it won't tell you if the working\n          copy was snapshotted or if descendants were rebased.\n          \n          Warnings and errors will still be printed.\n\n      --no-pager\n          Disable the pager\n\n      --config <NAME=VALUE>\n          Additional configuration options (can be repeated)\n          \n          The name should be specified as TOML dotted keys.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /logs/agent/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /logs/agent/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
