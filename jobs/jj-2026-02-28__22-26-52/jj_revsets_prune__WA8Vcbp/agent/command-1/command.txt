You have been working on a feature in a repository located at `/home/user/repo`.
During your development process, you created some experimental commits to test different approaches. Now that you have settled on a solution, you need to clean up your history by removing these experimental commits.

Your task is to:
1.  Navigate to the repository at `/home/user/repo`.
2.  Identify all commits that have the word "experiment" in their description. You should use `jj`'"'"'s revset language to find these.
3.  Abandon (delete) all of these experimental commits. The valid commits (those without "experiment" in the description) must be preserved, and their history should be linear (children of abandoned commits should be automatically rebased onto the abandoned commit'"'"'s parent).
4.  After you have abandoned the commits, generate a log of the remaining commits to verify the cleanup. Run the following command exactly to produce the verification file:
    `jj log -r '"'"'all()'"'"' --template '"'"'commit_id ++ " " ++ description ++ "\n"'"'"' > /home/user/remaining_commits.txt`

The final state should be a repository with a clean history containing only the feature commits, and a text file listing those remaining commits.
