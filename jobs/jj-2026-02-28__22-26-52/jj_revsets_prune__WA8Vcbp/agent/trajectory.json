Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /logs/agent/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /logs/agent/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS><environment_context>\n  <cwd>/</cwd>\n  <shell>bash</shell>\n</environment_context>"

You have been working on a feature in a repository located at `/home/user/repo`.\nDuring your development process, you created some experimental commits to test different approaches. Now that you have settled on a solution, you need to clean up your history by removing these experimental commits.\n\nYour task is to:\n1.  Navigate to the repository at `/home/user/repo`.\n2.  Identify all commits that have the word \"experiment\" in their description. You should use `jj`'s revset language to find these.\n3.  Abandon (delete) all of these experimental commits. The valid commits (those without \"experiment\" in the description) must be preserved, and their history should be linear (children of abandoned commits should be automatically rebased onto the abandoned commit's parent).\n4.  After you have abandoned the commits, generate a log of the remaining commits to verify the cleanup. Run the following command exactly to produce the verification file:\n    `jj log -r 'all()' --template 'commit_id ++ \" \" ++ description ++ \"\\n\"' > /home/user/remaining_commits.txt`\n\nThe final state should be a repository with a clean history containing only the feature commits, and a text file listing those remaining commits.\n"

The\n          working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the\n          working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead\n          see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be\n          useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the\n          working copy.\n          \n          Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies\n          `--ignore-working-copy`.\n\n      --ignore-immutable\n          Allow rewriting immutable commits\n          \n          By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits.\n          This option disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.\n          \n          This option only affects the check. It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or\n          the `immutable` template keyword.\n\n      --at-operation <AT_OPERATION>\n          Operation to load the repo at\n          \n          Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent\n          operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.\n          \n          You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier\n          operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would\n          have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the\n          same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.\n          \n          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation\n          ID is enough.\n          \n          When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if\n          `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.\n          \n          It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation.\n          Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier\n          operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.\n          \n          [aliases: --at-op]\n\n      --debug\n          Enable debug logging\n\n      --color <WHEN>\n          When to colorize output\n          \n          [possible values: always, never, debug, auto]\n\n      --quiet\n          Silence non-primary command output\n          \n          For example, `jj file list` will still list files, but it won't tell you if the working\n          copy was snapshotted or if descendants were rebased.\n          \n          Warnings and errors will still be printed.\n\n      --no-pager\n          Disable the pager\n\n      --config <NAME=VALUE>\n          Additional configuration options (can be repeated)\n          \n          The name should be specified as TOML dotted keys.
