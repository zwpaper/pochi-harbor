You are working in a repository located at `/home/user/repo`.

You have been working on a feature and made modifications to `src/utils.py`. You realized these changes are incorrect and break the build. You also added a new file `src/ideas.md` which contains valid notes you want to preserve.

Your task is to:
1.  Use `jj` commands to discard the changes made to `src/utils.py` in the working copy, restoring it to the state of the parent revision.
2.  Ensure `src/ideas.md` is preserved in the working copy.
3.  Generate a status report by running `jj status` and saving the output to `/home/user/repo/final_status.txt`.

Do not use `git checkout` or other Git commands. Use the appropriate `jj` command to restore the file.
