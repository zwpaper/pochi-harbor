These cannot be edited. They can be viewed in the\n  `cli/src/config/` directory in `jj`'s source repo.\n\n- The user settings. These can be edited with `jj config edit --user`. User\nsettings are located in [the user config files], which can be found with `jj\nconfig path --user`.\n\n- The repo settings. These can be edited with `jj config edit --repo`, or found\n  with `jj config path --repo`. For security reasons, they are not located inside\n  the repo.\n\n- The workspace settings. These can be edited with `jj config edit --workspace`,\n  or found with `jj config path --workspace`. For security reasons, they are not\n  located inside the workspace.\n\n- Settings [specified in the command-line](#specifying-config-on-the-command-line).\n\nThese are listed in the order they are loaded; the settings from earlier items\nin the list are overridden by the settings from later items if they disagree.\nEvery type of config except for the built-in settings is optional.\n\nYou can enable JSON Schema validation in your editor by adding a `#:schema`\nreference at the top of your TOML config files. See [JSON Schema\nSupport] for details.\n\nSee the [TOML site] and the [syntax guide] for a detailed description of the\nsyntax. We cover some of the basics below.\n\n[the user config files]: #user-config-files\n[TOML site]: https://toml.io/en/\n[syntax guide]: https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0\n[JSON Schema Support]: #json-schema-support\n\nThe first thing to remember is that the value of a setting (the part to the\nright of the `=` sign) should be surrounded in quotes if it's a string.\n\n### Dotted style and headings\nIn TOML, anything under a heading can be dotted instead. For example,\n`user.name = \"YOUR NAME\"` is equivalent to:\n\n```toml\n[user]\nname = \"YOUR NAME\"\n```\n\nFor future reference, here are a couple of more complicated examples,\n\n```toml\n# Dotted style\ntemplate-aliases.\"format_short_id(id)\" = \"id.shortest(12)\"\ncolors.\"commit_id prefix\".bold = true\n\n# is equivalent to:\n[template-aliases]\n\"format_short_id(id)\" = \"id.shortest(12)\"\n\n[colors]\n\"commit_id prefix\" = { bold = true }\n```\n\nThe docs below refer to keys in text using dotted notation, but example\nblocks will use heading notation to be unambiguous. If you are confident with TOML\nthen use whichever suits you in your config. If you mix dotted keys and headings,\n**you must put the dotted keys before the first heading**.\n\nThat's probably enough TOML to keep you out of trouble but the [syntax guide] is\nvery short if you ever need to check.\n\n## User settings\n\n```toml\n[user]\nname = \"YOUR NAME\"\nemail = \"YOUR_EMAIL@example.com\"\n```\n\nDon't forget to change these to your own details!\n\n## UI settings\n\n### Colorizing output\n\nPossible values are `always`, `never`, `debug` and `auto` (default: `auto`).\n`auto` will use color only when writing to a terminal. `debug` will print the\nactive labels alongside the regular colorized output.\n\nThis setting overrides the `NO_COLOR` environment variable (if set).\n\n```toml\n[ui]\ncolor = \"never\" # Turn off color\n```\n\n### Custom colors and styles\n\nYou can customize the colors used for various elements of the UI. For example:\n\n```toml\n[colors]\ncommit_id = \"green\"\n```\n\nThe following colors are available:\n\n* black\n* red\n* green\n* yellow\n* blue\n* magenta\n* cyan\n* white\n* default\n\nAll of them but \"default\" come in a bright version too, e.g. \"bright red\". The\n\"default\" color can be used to override a color defined by a parent style\n(explained below).\n\nYou can also use a 6-digit hex code for more control over the exact color used:\n\n```toml\n[colors]\nchange_id = \"#ff1525\"\n```\n\n`jj` also supports colors from the [ANSI 256-color palette] as `ansi-color-<N>`,\nwhere `<N>` is a number between 0 and 255:\n\n```toml\n[colors]\ncommit_id = \"ansi-color-81\"\n```\n\n[ANSI 256-color palette]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit\n\nIf you use a string value for a color, as in the examples above, it will be used\nfor the foreground color. You can also set the background color, reverse colors\n(swap foreground and background), or make the text bold, dim, italic, or\nunderlined. For that, you need to use a table:\n\n```toml\n[colors]\ncommit_id = { fg = \"green\", bg = \"#ff1525\", bold = true, underline = true }\nchange_id = { reverse = true, dim = false, italic = true }\n```\n\nThe key names are called \"labels\". The above used `commit_id` as label. You can\nalso create rules combining multiple labels. The rules work a bit like CSS\nselectors. For example, if you want to color commit IDs green in general but\nmake the commit ID of the working-copy commit also be underlined, you can do\nthis:\n\n```toml\n[colors]\ncommit_id = \"green\"\n\"working_copy commit_id\" = { underline = true }\n```\n\nParts of the style that are not overridden - such as the foreground color in the\nexample above - are inherited from the style of the parent label.\n\nWhich elements can be colored is not yet documented, but see\nthe [default color configuration](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/cli/src/config/colors.toml)\nfor some examples of what's possible.\n\n### Default command\n\nWhen `jj` is run with no explicit subcommand, the value of the\n`ui.default-command` setting will be used instead. Possible values are any valid\nsubcommand name, subcommand alias, or user-defined alias (defaults to `\"log\"`).\n\n```toml\n[ui]\ndefault-command = [\"log\", \"--reversed\"]\n```\n\n### Default description\n\nThe editor content of a commit description can be populated by the\n`draft_commit_description` template. `self` is a [`Commit`\nobject](templates.md#commit-type).\n\n```toml\n[templates]\ndraft_commit_description = '''\nconcat(\n  builtin_draft_commit_description,\n  \"\\nJJ: ignore-rest\\n\",\n  diff.git(),\n)\n'''\n```\n\nYou can override only the `default_commit_description` value if you like, e.g.:\n\n```toml\n[template-aliases]\ndefault_commit_description = '''\n\"\n\nCloses #NNNN\n\"\n'''\n```\n\n### Duplicate commit description\n\nBy default, `jj duplicate` copies the descriptions from the original commits.\nYou can customize this behavior by specifying the `duplicate_description`\ntemplate, which is given a [`Commit` object](templates.md#commit-type) of the\noriginal commit.\n\n```toml\n[templates]\nduplicate_description = '''\nconcat(\n  description.trim_end(),\n  \"\\n\\n(cherry picked from commit \",\n  commit_id,\n  \")\\n\"\n)\n'''\n```\n\nNote that `description` usually ends with a `\\n` if it is not blank. Use\n`.trim_end()` to remove the `\\n`.\n\n### Bookmark/tag listing order\n\nBy default, `jj bookmark list` and `jj tag list` display bookmarks and tags\nsorted alphabetically by name. You can customize this sorting behavior by\nspecifying sort keys in your config file:\n\n```toml\n[ui]\nbookmark-list-sort-keys = [\"name\"]\ntag-list-sort-keys = [\"name\"]\n```\n\nThe configuration works identically to using the `--sort` option. The following\nsort keys are supported: `name`, `author-name`, `author-email`, `author-date`,\n`committer-name`, `committer-email`, `committer-date`. Suffix the key with `-`\nto sort in descending order. Multiple keys can be supplied here, the first key\nis the most significant.\n\nWhen the `--sort` option is used, the configuration is ignored.\n\n### Commit trailers\n\nYou can configure automatic addition of one or more trailers to commit\ndescriptions using the `commit_trailers` template.\n\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or\n          the `immutable` template keyword.\n\n      --at-operation <AT_OPERATION>\n          Operation to load the repo at\n          \n          Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent\n          operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.\n          \n          You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier\n          operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would\n          have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the\n          same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.\n          \n          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation\n          ID is enough.\n          \n          When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if\n          `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.\n          \n          It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation.\n          Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier\n          operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.\n          \n          [aliases: --at-op]\n\n      --debug\n          Enable debug logging\n\n      --color <WHEN>\n          When to colorize output\n          \n          [possible values: always, never, debug, auto]\n\n      --quiet\n          Silence non-primary command output\n          \n          For example, `jj file list` will still list files, but it won't tell you if the working\n          copy was snapshotted or if descendants were rebased.\n          \n          Warnings and errors will still be printed.\n\n      --no-pager\n          Disable the pager\n\n      --config <NAME=VALUE>\n          Additional configuration options (can be repeated)\n          \n          The name should be specified as TOML dotted keys. The value should be specified as a TOML\n          expression. If string value isn't enclosed by any TOML constructs (such as array\n          notation), quotes can be omitted.\n\n      --config-file <PATH>\n          Additional configuration files (can be repeated)\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
