Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /logs/agent/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /logs/agent/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS><environment_context>\n  <cwd>/</cwd>\n  <shell>bash</shell>\n</environment_context>"

      "message": "# JJ Revset Prune Task\n\nYou are a developer migrating from Git to Jujutsu (`jj`). You are working in a repository located at `/home/user/repo`.\n\nThe current history contains a mistake: a revision with the description \"temporary debug info\" was accidentally created in the middle of the chain. It sits between the \"initial setup\" revision and your current working copy.\n\nYour goal is to clean up this history using `jj` commands.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1.  **Identify the bad revision**: Use a `jj log` command with a **revset** to find the revision specifically with the description \"temporary debug info\".\n2.  **Record the Change ID**: Save the **Change ID** (not the Commit ID) of that revision to a file named `/home/user/bad_revision_id.txt`. The file should contain *only* the Change ID string (e.g., `kkmpptxz...`).\n3.  **Prune the revision**: Use the `jj abandon` command to remove this revision from the history. Observe how `jj` handles the descendant revisions.\n4.  **Finalize work**: Ensure your current working copy revision has the description \"clean feature\" and contains a file named `status.txt` with the text content `ready`.\n\n## Expected Outcome\n\n*   The repository history should show \"clean feature\" as a direct descendant of \"initial setup\".\n*   The \"temporary debug info\" revision should no longer appear in the standard log.\n*   The file `/home/user/bad_revision_id.txt` must exist and contain the correct ID.\n*   The file `status.txt` exists in the working copy with the correct content.\n"

For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would\n          have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the\n          same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.\n          \n          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want.

The language\nconsists of symbols, operators, and functions.\n\nMost `jj` commands accept a revset (or multiple). Many commands, such as\n`jj edit <revset>` expect the revset to resolve to a single commit; it is an\nerror to pass a revset that resolves to more than one commit (or zero commits)\nto such commands.\n\nThe words \"revisions\" and \"commits\" are used interchangeably in this document.\n\n## Hidden revisions\n\nMost revsets search only the [visible commits](glossary.md#visible-commits).\nOther commits are only included if you explicitly mention them (e.g. by commit\nID, `<name>@<remote>` symbol, or `at_operation()` function).\n\nIf hidden commits are specified, their ancestors also become available to the\nsearch space. They are included in `all()`, `x..`, `~x`, etc., but not in\n`..visible_heads()`, etc. For example, `hidden_id | all()` is equivalent to\n`hidden_id | ::(hidden_id | visible_heads())`.\n\n## Symbols\n\nThe `@` expression refers to the working copy commit in the current workspace.\nUse `<workspace name>@` to refer to the working-copy commit in another\nworkspace. Use `<name>@<remote>` to refer to a remote-tracking tag/bookmark.\n\nA full commit ID refers to a single commit. A unique prefix of the full commit\nID can also be used. It is an error to use a non-unique prefix.\n\nA full change ID refers to a visible commit with that change ID. A unique prefix\nof the full change ID can also be used. It is an error to use a non-unique\nprefix or [a divergent change ID][divergent-change]. To refer to a\n[hidden](#hidden-revisions) commit or [divergent change][divergent-change], a\n[change offset][change-offset] can be added using `<change ID>/<offset>` syntax.\n\nUse [single or double quotes][string-literals] to prevent a symbol from being\ninterpreted as an expression. For example, `\"x-\"` is the symbol `x-`, not the\nparents of symbol `x`. Taking shell quoting into account, you may need to use\nsomething like `jj log -r '\"x-\"'`.\n\n[divergent-change]: glossary.md#divergent-change\n[change-offset]: glossary.md#change-offset\n[string-literals]: templates.md#stringliteral-type\n\n### Priority\n\nJujutsu attempts to resolve a symbol in the following order:\n\n1. Tag name\n2. Bookmark name\n3. Git ref\n4. Commit ID or change ID\n\nTo override the priority, use the appropriate [revset function](#functions). For\nexample, to resolve `abc` as a commit ID even if there happens to be a bookmark\nby the same name, use `commit_id(abc)`. This is particularly useful in scripts.\n\n## Operators\n\nThe following operators are supported. `x` and `y` below can be any revset, not\nonly symbols.\n\nOperators are listed in order of binding power from strongest to weakest, e.g.\n`x | y & z` is interpreted as `x | (y & z)` since `&` has stronger binding power\nthan `|`. Infix operators of the same binding power are parsed from left to\nright, e.g. `x ~ y & z` is interpreted as `(x ~ y) & z` rather than `x ~ (y &\nz)`.\n\nAs seen above, parentheses can be used to control evaluation order, e.g. `(x &\ny) | z` or `x & (y | z)`.\n\n<!-- The following list is based on `PRATT` in `revset_parser.rs`. -->\n\n1. * `x-`: Parents of `x`, can be empty.\n   * `x+`: Children of `x`, can be empty.\n\n2. * `x::`: Descendants of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself. Equivalent to\n     `x::visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.\n   * `x..`: Revisions that are not ancestors of `x`. Equivalent to `~::x`, and\n     `x..visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.\n   * `::x`: Ancestors of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself. Shorthand for\n     `root()::x`.\n   * `..x`: Ancestors of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself, but excluding\n     the root commit. Shorthand for `root()..x`. Equivalent to `::x ~ root()`.\n   * `x::y`: Descendants of `x` that are also ancestors of `y`. Equivalent\n      to `x:: & ::y`. This is what `git log` calls `--ancestry-path x..y`.\n   * `x..y`: Ancestors of `y` that are not also ancestors of `x`. Equivalent to\n     `::y ~ ::x`. This is what `git log` calls `x..y` (i.e. the same as we call it).\n   * `::`: All visible commits in the repo. Equivalent to `all()`, and\n     `root()::visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.\n   * `..`: All visible commits in the repo, but excluding the root commit.\n     Equivalent to `~root()`, and `root()..visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions\n     are mentioned.\n\n3. * `~x`: Revisions that are not in `x`.\n\n4. * `x & y`: Revisions that are in both `x` and `y`.\n   * `x ~ y`: Revisions that are in `x` but not in `y`.\n\n5. * `x | y`: Revisions that are in either `x` or `y` (or both).\n\n<!-- The following format will be understood by the web site generator, and will\n generate a folded section that can be unfolded at will. -->\n\n??? examples\n\n    Given this history:\n    ```\n    o D\n    |\\\n    | o C\n    | |\n    o | B\n    |/\n    o A\n    |\n    o root()\n    ```\n\n    **Operator** `x-`\n\n    * `D-` \u21d2 `{C,B}`\n    * `B-` \u21d2 `{A}`\n    * `A-` \u21d2 `{root()}`\n    * `root()-` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `none()-` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `(D|A)-` \u21d2 `{C,B,root()}`\n    * `(C|B)-` \u21d2 `{A}`\n\n    **Operator** `x+`\n\n    * `D+` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `B+` \u21d2 `{D}`\n    * `A+` \u21d2 `{B,C}`\n    * `root()+` \u21d2 `{A}`\n    * `none()+` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `(C|B)+` \u21d2 `{D}`\n    * `(B|root())+` \u21d2 `{D,A}`\n\n    **Operator** `x::`\n\n    * `D::` \u21d2 `{D}`\n    * `B::` \u21d2 `{D,B}`\n    * `A::` \u21d2 `{D,C,B,A}`\n    * `root()::` \u21d2 `{D,C,B,A,root()}`\n    * `none()::` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `(C|B)::` \u21d2 `{D,C,B}`\n\n    **Operator** `x..`\n\n    * `D..` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `B..` \u21d2 `{D,C}` (note that, unlike `B::`, this includes `C`)\n    * `A..` \u21d2 `{D,C,B}`\n    * `root()..` \u21d2 `{D,C,B,A}`\n    * `none()..` \u21d2 `{D,C,B,A,root()}`\n    * `(C|B)..` \u21d2 `{D}`\n\n    **Operator** `::x`\n\n    * `::D` \u21d2 `{D,C,B,A,root()}`\n    * `::B` \u21d2 `{B,A,root()}`\n    * `::A` \u21d2 `{A,root()}`\n    * `::root()` \u21d2 `{root()}`\n    * `::none()` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `::(C|B)` \u21d2 `{C,B,A,root()}`\n\n    **Operator** `..x`\n\n    * `..D` \u21d2 `{D,C,B,A}`\n    * `..B` \u21d2 `{B,A}`\n    * `..A` \u21d2 `{A}`\n    * `..root()` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `..none()` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `..(C|B)` \u21d2 `{C,B,A}`\n\n    **Operator** `x::y`\n\n    * `D::D` \u21d2 `{D}`\n    * `B::D` \u21d2 `{D,B}` (note that, unlike `B..D`, this includes `B` and excludes `C`)\n    * `B::C` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set) (note that, unlike `B..C`, this excludes `C`)\n    * `A::D` \u21d2 `{D,C,B,A}`\n    * `root()::D` \u21d2 `{D,C,B,A,root()}`\n    * `none()::D` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `D::B` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `(C|B)::(C|B)` \u21d2 `{C,B}`\n\n    **Operator** `x..y`\n\n    * `D..D` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `B..D` \u21d2 `{D,C}` (note that, unlike `B::D`, this includes `C` and excludes `B`)\n    * `B..C` \u21d2 `{C}` (note that, unlike `B::C`, this includes `C`)\n    * `A..D` \u21d2 `{D,C,B}`\n    * `root()..D` \u21d2 `{D,C,B,A}`\n    * `none()..D` \u21d2 `{D,C,B,A,root()}`\n    * `D..B` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n    * `(C|B)..(C|B)` \u21d2 `{}` (empty set)\n\n## Functions\n\nYou can also specify revisions by using functions. Some functions take other\nrevsets (expressions) as arguments.\n\n??? note \"Function argument syntax\"\n\n    In this documentation, optional arguments are indicated with square\n    brackets like `[arg]`. Some arguments also have an optional label which can\n    be used to specify that argument without specifying all previous arguments.\n\n    For instance, `remote_bookmarks([name_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`\n    indicates that all of the following usages are valid:\n\n    * `remote_bookmarks()`\n    * `remote_bookmarks(\"main\")`\n    * `remote_bookmarks(\"main\", \"origin\")`\n    * `remote_bookmarks(\"main\", remote=\"origin\")`\n    * `remote_bookmarks(remote=\"origin\")`\n\n* `parents(x, [depth])`: `parents(x)` is the same as `x-`.\n  `parents(x, depth)` returns the parents of `x` at the given `depth`. For\n  instance, `parents(x, 3)` is equivalent to `x---`.\n\n* `children(x, [depth])`: `children(x)` is the same as `x+`.\n  `children(x, depth)` returns the children of `x` at the given `depth`. For\n  instance, `children(x, 3)` is equivalent to `x+++`.\n\n* `ancestors(x, [depth])`: `ancestors(x)` is the same as `::x`.\n  `ancestors(x, depth)` returns the ancestors of `x` limited to the given\n  `depth`.\n\n* `descendants(x, [depth])`: `descendants(x)` is the same as `x::`.\n  `descendants(x, depth)` returns the descendants of `x` limited to the given\n  `depth`.\n\n* `first_parent(x, [depth])`: `first_parent(x)` is similar to `parents(x)`, but\n  for merges, it only returns the first parent instead of returning all parents.\n  The `depth` argument also works similarly, so `first_parent(x, 2)` is\n  equivalent to `first_parent(first_parent(x))`.\n\n* `first_ancestors(x, [depth])`: Similar to `ancestors(x, [depth])`, but only\n  traverses the first parent of each commit. In Git, the first parent of a merge\n  commit is conventionally the branch into which changes are being merged, so\n  `first_ancestors()` can be used to exclude changes made on other branches.\n\n* `reachable(srcs, domain)`: All commits reachable from `srcs` within\n  `domain`, traversing all parent and child edges. `srcs` outside `domain` are\n  not considered even if a parent or child edge would reach into `domain`.\n\n* `connected(x)`: Same as `x::x`. Useful when `x` includes several commits.\n\n* `all()`: All visible commits and ancestors of commits explicitly mentioned.\n\n* `none()`: No commits. This function is rarely useful; it is provided for\n  completeness.\n\n* `change_id(prefix)`: Commits with the given change ID prefix. If the specified\n  change is divergent, this resolves to multiple commits. It is an error to use a\n  non-unique prefix. Unmatched prefix isn't an error.\n\n* `commit_id(prefix)`: Commits with the given commit ID prefix. It is an error\n  to use a non-unique prefix. Unmatched prefix isn't an error.\n\n* `bookmarks([pattern])`: All local bookmark targets. If `pattern` is specified,\n  this selects the bookmarks whose name match the given [string\n  pattern](#string-patterns). For example, `bookmarks(*push*)` would match the\n  bookmarks `push-123` and `repushed` but not the bookmark `main`. If a bookmark\n  is in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are included.\n\n* `remote_bookmarks([name_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`: All remote\n  bookmarks targets across all remotes. If just the `name_pattern` is specified,\n  the bookmarks whose names match the given [string pattern](#string-patterns)\n  across all remotes are selected. If both `name_pattern` and `remote_pattern`\n  are specified, the selection is further restricted to just the remotes whose\n  names match `remote_pattern`.\n\n  For example, `remote_bookmarks(*push*, *ri*)` would match the bookmarks\n  `push-123@origin` and `repushed@private` but not `push-123@upstream` or\n  `main@origin` or `main@upstream`. If a bookmark is in a conflicted state, all\n  its possible targets are included.\n\n  Git-tracking bookmarks are excluded by default. Use `remote=\"git\"` or\n  `remote=\"*\"` to select bookmarks including `@git` ones.\n\n* `tracked_remote_bookmarks([name_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`: All\n  targets of tracked remote bookmarks. Supports the same optional arguments as\n  `remote_bookmarks()`.\n\n* `untracked_remote_bookmarks([name_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`: All\n  targets of untracked remote bookmarks. Supports the same optional arguments as\n  `remote_bookmarks()`.\n\n* `tags([pattern])`: All tag targets. If `pattern` is specified, this selects\n  the tags whose name match the given [string pattern](#string-patterns). For\n  example, `tags(*v1*)` would match the tags `v123` and `rev1` but not the tag\n  `v2`. If a tag is in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are\n  included.\n\n* `remote_tags([name_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`: All remote tags\n  targets across all remotes. See `remote_bookmarks()` for arguments.\n\n* `visible_heads()`: All visible heads (same as `heads(all())` if no hidden\n  revisions are mentioned).\n\n* `root()`: The virtual commit that is the oldest ancestor of all other commits.\n\n* `heads(x)`: Commits in `x` that are not ancestors of other commits in `x`.\n  Equivalent to `x ~ ::x-`. Note that this is different from\n  [Mercurial's](https://repo.mercurial-scm.org/hg/help/revsets) `heads(x)`\n  function, which is equivalent to `x ~ x-`.\n\n* `roots(x)`: Commits in `x` that are not descendants of other commits in `x`.\n  Equivalent to `x ~ x+::`. Note that this is different from\n  [Mercurial's](https://repo.mercurial-scm.org/hg/help/revsets) `roots(x)`\n  function, which is equivalent to `x ~ x+`.\n\n* `latest(x, [count])`: Latest `count` commits in `x`, based on committer\n"

For\n  example, `description(\"\")` matches commits without description, and\n  `description(\"foo\\n\")` matches commits with description `\"foo\\n\"`.\n\n* `subject(pattern)`: Commits that have a subject matching the given [string\n  pattern](#string-patterns). A subject is the first line of the description\n  (without newline character.)\n\n* `author(pattern)`: Commits with the author's name or email matching the given\n  [string pattern](#string-patterns). Equivalent to `author_name(pattern) |\n  author_email(pattern)`.\n\n* `author_name(pattern)`: Commits with the author's name matching the given\n  [string pattern](#string-patterns).\n\n* `author_email(pattern)`: Commits with the author's email matching the given\n  [string pattern](#string-patterns).\n\n* `author_date(pattern)`: Commits with author dates matching the specified [date\n"

However, builtin\nfunction will be shadowed by name, and can't co-exist with aliases.\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\n[revset-aliases]\n'HEAD' = '@-'\n'user()' = 'user(\"me@example.org\")'\n'user(x)' = 'author(x) | committer(x)'\n```\n\n### Built-in Aliases\n\nThe following aliases are built-in and used for certain operations. These functions\nare defined as aliases in order to allow you to overwrite them as needed.\nSee [revsets.toml](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/cli/src/config/revsets.toml)\nfor a comprehensive list.\n\n* `trunk()`: Resolves to the head commit for the default bookmark of the default\n  remote, or the remote named `upstream` or `origin`. This is set at the\n  repository level upon initialization of a Jujutsu repository.\n\n  If the default bookmark cannot be resolved during initialization, the default\n  global configuration tries the bookmarks `main`, `master`, and `trunk` on the\n  `upstream` and `origin` remotes. If more than one potential trunk commit\n  exists, the newest one is chosen. If none of the bookmarks exist, the revset\n  evaluates to `root()`.\n\n  You can [override](./config.md) this as appropriate. If you do, make sure it\n  always resolves to exactly one commit. For example:\n\n  ```toml\n  [revset-aliases]\n  'trunk()' = 'your-bookmark@your-remote'\n  ```\n\n"
