trap 'rm -rf /tmp/codex-secrets "$CODEX_HOME/auth.json"' EXIT TERM INT; codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --skip-git-repo-check --model gpt-5.3-codex --json --enable unified_exec -c model_reasoning_effort=high -- 'You are a developer working in a Jujutsu (`jj`) repository located at `/home/user/repo`.

The repository contains a configuration file `config.toml`.
Two divergent lines of development have occurred:
1.  The `main` bookmark updated the version to "1.1".
2.  The `feature` bookmark updated the version to "1.0-beta" (based on "1.0").

Your task is to rebase the `feature` work onto the latest `main` and resolve the conflict.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Navigate** to `/home/user/repo`.
2.  **Rebase** the revision tracked by `feature` onto the revision tracked by `main`.
3.  **Resolve** the conflict in `config.toml`. The resolved content must be exactly:
    ```toml
    [package]
    name = "my-app"
    version = "1.1-beta"
    ```
4.  **Verify** that the conflict is resolved in the working copy.
5.  **Create** a verification file named `solution.txt` containing the output of `jj log -r feature --no-graph`.

**Constraints:**
*   Use `jj` commands.
*   Ensure `feature` points to the resolved commit.
*   The final state of the repository should have no conflict markers in `config.toml`.
