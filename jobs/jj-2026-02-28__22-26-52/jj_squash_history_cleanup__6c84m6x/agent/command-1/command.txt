You are working on a weather application located at `/home/user/weather_app`.

You have been working on a precipitation tracking feature and have created a messy history of commits. The current state of the repository (viewable via `jj log`) shows a chain of three commits associated with the `feature/precip` bookmark:

1. `feat: add rain tracking` (The base commit of the feature)
2. `fix: calculation error` (A fix on top of the base)
3. `docs: update readme` (Documentation changes on top of the fix)

Your goal is to clean up this history before merging. You need to combine these three commits into a single atomic commit.

**Requirements:**

1.  Squash the `fix: calculation error` and `docs: update readme` commits into the original `feat: add rain tracking` commit.
2.  Update the description of the resulting single commit to: `feat: complete rain tracking feature`.
3.  Ensure the `feature/precip` bookmark points to this new, single commit.
4.  The final state should show `feature/precip` directly following the main branch (or its original parent), with no intermediate history.

Use `jj` commands to perform these operations. Do not use `git` commands.
