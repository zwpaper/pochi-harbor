For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would\n          have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the\n          same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.\n          \n          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want.

{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_18","type":"command_execution","command":"/bin/bash -lc \"cd /home/user/repo && jj help -k revsets | sed -n '1,320p'\"","aggregated_output":"# Revsets\n\nJujutsu supports a functional language for selecting a set of revisions.\nExpressions in this language are called \"revsets\" (the idea comes from\n[Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/help/revsets)). The language\nconsists of symbols, operators, and functions.\n\nMost `jj` commands accept a revset (or multiple). Many commands, such as\n`jj edit <revset>` expect the revset to resolve to a single commit; it is an\nerror to pass a revset that resolves to more than one commit (or zero commits)\nto such commands.\n\nThe words \"revisions\" and \"commits\" are used interchangeably in this document.\n\n## Hidden revisions\n\nMost revsets search only the [visible commits](glossary.md#visible-commits).\nOther commits are only included if you explicitly mention them (e.g. by commit\nID, `<name>@<remote>` symbol, or `at_operation()` function).\n\nIf hidden commits are specified, their ancestors also become available to the\nsearch space. They are included in `all()`, `x..`, `~x`, etc., but not in\n`..visible_heads()`, etc. For example, `hidden_id | all()` is equivalent to\n`hidden_id | ::(hidden_id | visible_heads())`.\n\n## Symbols\n\nThe `@` expression refers to the working copy commit in the current workspace.\nUse `<workspace name>@` to refer to the working-copy commit in another\nworkspace. Use `<name>@<remote>` to refer to a remote-tracking tag/bookmark.\n\nA full commit ID refers to a single commit. A unique prefix of the full commit\nID can also be used. It is an error to use a non-unique prefix.\n\nA full change ID refers to a visible commit with that change ID. A unique prefix\nof the full change ID can also be used. It is an error to use a non-unique\nprefix or [a divergent change ID][divergent-change]. To refer to a\n[hidden](#hidden-revisions) commit or [divergent change][divergent-change], a\n[change offset][change-offset] can be added using `<change ID>/<offset>` syntax.\n\nUse [single or double quotes][string-literals] to prevent a symbol from being\ninterpreted as an expression. For example, `\"x-\"` is the symbol `x-`, not the\nparents of symbol `x`. Taking shell quoting into account, you may need to use\nsomething like `jj log -r '\"x-\"'`.\n\n[divergent-change]: glossary.md#divergent-change\n[change-offset]: glossary.md#change-offset\n[string-literals]: templates.md#stringliteral-type\n\n### Priority\n\nJujutsu attempts to resolve a symbol in the following order:\n\n1. Tag name\n2. Bookmark name\n3. Git ref\n4. Commit ID or change ID\n\nTo override the priority, use the appropriate [revset function](#functions). For\nexample, to resolve `abc` as a commit ID even if there happens to be a bookmark\nby the same name, use `commit_id(abc)`. This is particularly useful in scripts.\n\n## Operators\n\nThe following operators are supported. `x` and `y` below can be any revset, not\nonly symbols.\n\nOperators are listed in order of binding power from strongest to weakest, e.g.\n`x | y & z` is interpreted as `x | (y & z)` since `&` has stronger binding power\nthan `|`. Infix operators of the same binding power are parsed from left to\nright, e.g. `x ~ y & z` is interpreted as `(x ~ y) & z` rather than `x ~ (y &\nz)`.\n\nAs seen above, parentheses can be used to control evaluation order, e.g. `(x &\ny) | z` or `x & (y | z)`.\n\n<!-- The following list is based on `PRATT` in `revset_parser.rs`. -->\n\n1. * `x-`: Parents of `x`, can be empty.\n   * `x+`: Children of `x`, can be empty.\n\n2. * `x::`: Descendants of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself. Equivalent to\n     `x::visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.\n   * `x..`: Revisions that are not ancestors of `x`. Equivalent to `~::x`, and\n     `x..visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.\n   * `::x`: Ancestors of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself. Shorthand for\n     `root()::x`.\n   * `..x`: Ancestors of `x`, including the commits in `x` itself, but excluding\n     the root commit. Shorthand for `root()..x`. Equivalent to `::x ~ root()`.\n   * `x::y`: Descendants of `x` that are also ancestors of `y`. Equivalent\n      to `x:: & ::y`. This is what `git log` calls `--ancestry-path x..y`.\n   * `x..y`: Ancestors of `y` that are not also ancestors of `x`. Equivalent to\n     `::y ~ ::x`. This is what `git log` calls `x..y` (i.e. the same as we call it).\n   * `::`: All visible commits in the repo. Equivalent to `all()`, and\n     `root()::visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions are mentioned.\n   * `..`: All visible commits in the repo, but excluding the root commit.\n     Equivalent to `~root()`, and `root()..visible_heads()` if no hidden revisions\n     are mentioned.\n\n3. * `~x`: Revisions that are not in `x`.\n\n4. * `x & y`: Revisions that are in both `x` and `y`.\n   * `x ~ y`: Revisions that are in `x` but not in `y`.\n\n5. * `x | y`: Revisions that are in either `x` or `y` (or both).\n\n<!-- The following format will be understood by the web site generator, and will\n generate a folded section that can be unfolded at will. -->\n\n??? examples\n\n    Given this history:\n    ```\n    o D\n    |\\\n    | o C\n    | |\n    o | B\n    |/\n    o A\n    |\n    o root()\n    ```\n\n    **Operator** `x-`\n\n    * `D-` ⇒ `{C,B}`\n    * `B-` ⇒ `{A}`\n    * `A-` ⇒ `{root()}`\n    * `root()-` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `none()-` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `(D|A)-` ⇒ `{C,B,root()}`\n    * `(C|B)-` ⇒ `{A}`\n\n    **Operator** `x+`\n\n    * `D+` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `B+` ⇒ `{D}`\n    * `A+` ⇒ `{B,C}`\n    * `root()+` ⇒ `{A}`\n    * `none()+` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `(C|B)+` ⇒ `{D}`\n    * `(B|root())+` ⇒ `{D,A}`\n\n    **Operator** `x::`\n\n    * `D::` ⇒ `{D}`\n    * `B::` ⇒ `{D,B}`\n    * `A::` ⇒ `{D,C,B,A}`\n    * `root()::` ⇒ `{D,C,B,A,root()}`\n    * `none()::` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `(C|B)::` ⇒ `{D,C,B}`\n\n    **Operator** `x..`\n\n    * `D..` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `B..` ⇒ `{D,C}` (note that, unlike `B::`, this includes `C`)\n    * `A..` ⇒ `{D,C,B}`\n    * `root()..` ⇒ `{D,C,B,A}`\n    * `none()..` ⇒ `{D,C,B,A,root()}`\n    * `(C|B)..` ⇒ `{D}`\n\n    **Operator** `::x`\n\n    * `::D` ⇒ `{D,C,B,A,root()}`\n    * `::B` ⇒ `{B,A,root()}`\n    * `::A` ⇒ `{A,root()}`\n    * `::root()` ⇒ `{root()}`\n    * `::none()` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `::(C|B)` ⇒ `{C,B,A,root()}`\n\n    **Operator** `..x`\n\n    * `..D` ⇒ `{D,C,B,A}`\n    * `..B` ⇒ `{B,A}`\n    * `..A` ⇒ `{A}`\n    * `..root()` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `..none()` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `..(C|B)` ⇒ `{C,B,A}`\n\n    **Operator** `x::y`\n\n    * `D::D` ⇒ `{D}`\n    * `B::D` ⇒ `{D,B}` (note that, unlike `B..D`, this includes `B` and excludes `C`)\n    * `B::C` ⇒ `{}` (empty set) (note that, unlike `B..C`, this excludes `C`)\n    * `A::D` ⇒ `{D,C,B,A}`\n    * `root()::D` ⇒ `{D,C,B,A,root()}`\n    * `none()::D` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `D::B` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `(C|B)::(C|B)` ⇒ `{C,B}`\n\n    **Operator** `x..y`\n\n    * `D..D` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `B..D` ⇒ `{D,C}` (note that, unlike `B::D`, this includes `C` and excludes `B`)\n    * `B..C` ⇒ `{C}` (note that, unlike `B::C`, this includes `C`)\n    * `A..D` ⇒ `{D,C,B}`\n    * `root()..D` ⇒ `{D,C,B,A}`\n    * `none()..D` ⇒ `{D,C,B,A,root()}`\n    * `D..B` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n    * `(C|B)..(C|B)` ⇒ `{}` (empty set)\n\n## Functions\n\nYou can also specify revisions by using functions. Some functions take other\nrevsets (expressions) as arguments.\n\n??? note \"Function argument syntax\"\n\n    In this documentation, optional arguments are indicated with square\n    brackets like `[arg]`. Some arguments also have an optional label which can\n    be used to specify that argument without specifying all previous arguments.\n\n    For instance, `remote_bookmarks([name_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`\n    indicates that all of the following usages are valid:\n\n    * `remote_bookmarks()`\n    * `remote_bookmarks(\"main\")`\n    * `remote_bookmarks(\"main\", \"origin\")`\n    * `remote_bookmarks(\"main\", remote=\"origin\")`\n    * `remote_bookmarks(remote=\"origin\")`\n\n* `parents(x, [depth])`: `parents(x)` is the same as `x-`.\n  `parents(x, depth)` returns the parents of `x` at the given `depth`. For\n  instance, `parents(x, 3)` is equivalent to `x---`.\n\n* `children(x, [depth])`: `children(x)` is the same as `x+`.\n  `children(x, depth)` returns the children of `x` at the given `depth`. For\n  instance, `children(x, 3)` is equivalent to `x+++`.\n\n* `ancestors(x, [depth])`: `ancestors(x)` is the same as `::x`.\n  `ancestors(x, depth)` returns the ancestors of `x` limited to the given\n  `depth`.\n\n* `descendants(x, [depth])`: `descendants(x)` is the same as `x::`.\n  `descendants(x, depth)` returns the descendants of `x` limited to the given\n  `depth`.\n\n* `first_parent(x, [depth])`: `first_parent(x)` is similar to `parents(x)`, but\n  for merges, it only returns the first parent instead of returning all parents.\n  The `depth` argument also works similarly, so `first_parent(x, 2)` is\n  equivalent to `first_parent(first_parent(x))`.\n\n* `first_ancestors(x, [depth])`: Similar to `ancestors(x, [depth])`, but only\n  traverses the first parent of each commit. In Git, the first parent of a merge\n  commit is conventionally the branch into which changes are being merged, so\n  `first_ancestors()` can be used to exclude changes made on other branches.\n\n* `reachable(srcs, domain)`: All commits reachable from `srcs` within\n  `domain`, traversing all parent and child edges. `srcs` outside `domain` are\n  not considered even if a parent or child edge would reach into `domain`.\n\n* `connected(x)`: Same as `x::x`. Useful when `x` includes several commits.\n\n* `all()`: All visible commits and ancestors of commits explicitly mentioned.\n\n* `none()`: No commits. This function is rarely useful; it is provided for\n  completeness.\n\n* `change_id(prefix)`: Commits with the given change ID prefix. If the specified\n  change is divergent, this resolves to multiple commits. It is an error to use a\n  non-unique prefix. Unmatched prefix isn't an error.\n\n* `commit_id(prefix)`: Commits with the given commit ID prefix. It is an error\n  to use a non-unique prefix. Unmatched prefix isn't an error.\n\n* `bookmarks([pattern])`: All local bookmark targets. If `pattern` is specified,\n  this selects the bookmarks whose name match the given [string\n  pattern](#string-patterns). For example, `bookmarks(*push*)` would match the\n  bookmarks `push-123` and `repushed` but not the bookmark `main`. If a bookmark\n  is in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are included.\n\n* `remote_bookmarks([name_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`: All remote\n  bookmarks targets across all remotes. If just the `name_pattern` is specified,\n  the bookmarks whose names match the given [string pattern](#string-patterns)\n  across all remotes are selected. If both `name_pattern` and `remote_pattern`\n  are specified, the selection is further restricted to just the remotes whose\n  names match `remote_pattern`.\n\n  For example, `remote_bookmarks(*push*, *ri*)` would match the bookmarks\n  `push-123@origin` and `repushed@private` but not `push-123@upstream` or\n  `main@origin` or `main@upstream`. If a bookmark is in a conflicted state, all\n  its possible targets are included.\n\n  Git-tracking bookmarks are excluded by default. Use `remote=\"git\"` or\n  `remote=\"*\"` to select bookmarks including `@git` ones.\n\n* `tracked_remote_bookmarks([name_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`: All\n  targets of tracked remote bookmarks. Supports the same optional arguments as\n  `remote_bookmarks()`.\n\n* `untracked_remote_bookmarks([name_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`: All\n  targets of untracked remote bookmarks. Supports the same optional arguments as\n  `remote_bookmarks()`.\n\n* `tags([pattern])`: All tag targets. If `pattern` is specified, this selects\n  the tags whose name match the given [string pattern](#string-patterns). For\n  example, `tags(*v1*)` would match the tags `v123` and `rev1` but not the tag\n  `v2`. If a tag is in a conflicted state, all its possible targets are\n  included.\n\n* `remote_tags([name_pattern], [[remote=]remote_pattern])`: All remote tags\n  targets across all remotes. See `remote_bookmarks()` for arguments.\n\n* `visible_heads()`: All visible heads (same as `heads(all())` if no hidden\n  revisions are mentioned).\n\n* `root()`: The virtual commit that is the oldest ancestor of all other commits.\n\n* `heads(x)`: Commits in `x` that are not ancestors of other commits in `x`.\n  Equivalent to `x ~ ::x-`. Note that this is different from\n  [Mercurial's](https://repo.mercurial-scm.org/hg/help/revsets) `heads(x)`\n  function, which is equivalent to `x ~ x-`.\n\n* `roots(x)`: Commits in `x` that are not descendants of other commits in `x`.\n  Equivalent to `x ~ x+::`. Note that this is different from\n  [Mercurial's](https://repo.mercurial-scm.org/hg/help/revsets) `roots(x)`\n  function, which is equivalent to `x ~ x+`.\n\n* `latest(x, [count])`: Latest `count` commits in `x`, based on committer\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

These functions\nare defined as aliases in order to allow you to overwrite them as needed.\nSee [revsets.toml](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/cli/src/config/revsets.toml)\nfor a comprehensive list.\n\n* `trunk()`: Resolves to the head commit for the default bookmark of the default\n  remote, or the remote named `upstream` or `origin`. This is set at the\n  repository level upon initialization of a Jujutsu repository.\n\n  If the default bookmark cannot be resolved during initialization, the default\n  global configuration tries the bookmarks `main`, `master`, and `trunk` on the\n  `upstream` and `origin` remotes. If more than one potential trunk commit\n  exists, the newest one is chosen. If none of the bookmarks exist, the revset\n  evaluates to `root()`.\n\n  You can [override](./config.md) this as appropriate. If you do, make sure it\n  always resolves to exactly one commit. For example:\n\n  ```toml\n  [revset-aliases]\n  'trunk()' = 'your-bookmark@your-remote'\n  ```\n\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
