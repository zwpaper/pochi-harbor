If either is\nleft out, it defaults to the working-copy commit. For example, `jj squash --into @--` moves changes\nfrom the working-copy commit to the grandparent.\n\nIf, after moving changes out, the source revision is empty compared to its parent(s), and\n`--keep-emptied` is not set, it will be abandoned. Without `--interactive` or paths, the source\nrevision will always be empty.\n\nIf the source was abandoned and both the source and destination had a non-empty description, you\nwill be asked for the combined description. If either was empty, then the other one will be used.\n\nIf a working-copy commit gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty commit. This is true in\ngeneral; it is not specific to this command.\n\nThe name \"squash\" comes from the idea of combining (squashing) the changes from multiple revisions\ntogether.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL FEATURES\n\nAn alternative squashing UI is available via the `-o`, `-A`, and `-B` options.
